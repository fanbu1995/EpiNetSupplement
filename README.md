# CoEpiNet
Codes for _Likelihood-based Inference for Partially Observed Epidemics on Dynamic Networks_

## Things included
1. simulation codes (both SIR- and SIS-type) epidemic processes on adaptive networks
2. inference codes on complete data
3. inference codes on partially observed data w/ missing recovery times
4. codes for generating visualizations of toy examples
5. example datasets from simulations

## Things **not** included
1. real data (proprietary)
2. codes for running inference on real data

## How to run simulations
```{r}
rnorm(100)
```
